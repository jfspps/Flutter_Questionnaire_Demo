# questionnaire

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Google fonts

Google fonts were added with the command ```flutter pub add google_fonts```, which retrieves the 
package from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). This command automatically updates the [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml) 
dependencies list.
